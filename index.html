								<p> Prepaid cell phone plans are gaining traction. Every year, we see at least one company launching prepaid services.
								The major postpaid carriers are all launching prepaid flanker brands in order to gain market share.
								Some of these prepaid plans are gaining a lot of traction due to their competitive prices. 
								Tech Dot compiled a list of the best prepaid cell phone plans.
